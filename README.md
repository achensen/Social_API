## Additional Notes 
 The initial code for this project was provided by EDX Engineering Services Company as a homework activity that I repurposed as starter code to complete an assignment for a Full Stack Web Development Course. My contribution was to set an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. You'll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. I did receive tutoring assistance to help with my understanding of this assignment, specifically with routes and virtuals.
